The ShowTable project is a tool developed in multiple languages to 
read data in a variety of input formats, and output the data after
"normalizing" it, in one of several possible formats.

The Perl version has been around for many years; the Ruby version is 
just now being developed.

Each package provides a library for other applications to use, and a script
that is a client of the library and performs a filtering and presentation
function on data.

The program is called "showtable", and the library is called "ShowTable".

In Perl, you would use ShowTable like this:

  use ShowTable;
  ...
  show_table some_data

In Ruby, the invocation is:

  require 'show-table'
  ...
  show_table some_data

I'm considering developing a version in Python.  TBD.

Contributions or improvements are welcome.
